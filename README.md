<p>Clue Three is a Guess Who! style guessing game. Guess the Unknown Character chosen from a group with unique traits by typing questions in the input box. Each question gives a "Yes!" or "No!" answer in a clue box, and the player gets only 3 chances. Based on clues, the player has to deduce the Unknown Character. If the player doesn't guess in 3 tries, they are forced to guess. Click "GUESS" to guess and "RESET" to start a new game.</p>
