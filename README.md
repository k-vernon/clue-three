Clue Three is a guessing game based off of Guess Who! The object of the game is to guess the Unknown Character that is randomly chosen from the character group. Each character has a specific list of traits that make them unique. For example, Bella had brown hair while Ashley has black hair. In order to correctly guess the Unknown Character, players have the option to ask questions about them into the input at the bottom of the board! After typing and submitting a question, the game will add a clue to the clue box, answering with "Yes!" or "No!" to the player's question. For example, if they player asks "Brown hair?" and the Unknown Character does not have brown hair, a clue reading "Brown hair? No!"
will be submitted to the clue box. The player only has 3 chances to ask a question, giving them 3 clues. Based on clues given, the player can deduce who the Unknown Character is. If the player uses all 3 slots for clues, the game forces them to guess! The player may also guess before all three cluess are given by clicking the "GUESS" button under the Unknown Character's card. When the player has to guess, a new input is available for the player to guess the Unknown Character's name. If the player guesses correctly, they win! If they guess incorrectly, they lose!
