<p>Clue Three is a guessing game based on Guess Who! The object of the game is to guess the Unknown Character that is randomly chosen from the character group. Each character has a specific list of traits that make them unique. For example, Bella has brown hair while Ashley has black hair. <br><br> To correctly guess the Unknown Character, players have the option to type questions about them in the input at the bottom of the board! After typing and submitting a question, the game will add a clue to the clue box, answering with "Yes!" or "No!" to the player's question. For example, if the player asks "Brown hair?" and the Unknown Character does not have brown hair, a clue reading "Brown hair? No!"
will be submitted to the clue box. The player only has 3 chances to ask a question, giving them 3 clues. <br></br>Based on clues given, the player can deduce who the Unknown Character is. If the player uses all 3 slots for clues, the game forces them to guess! The player may also guess before all three clues are given by clicking the "GUESS" button under the Unknown Character's card. When the player has to guess, a new input is made available under the Unknown Character's card for the player to type their guess of the Unknown Character's name. If the player guesses correctly, they win! If they guess incorrectly, they lose!
